Any of the reserved characters above can be legally used in a URI without encoding, either to serve their syntactic purpose or just as literal characters in data in some places where such use could not be misinterpreted as the character serving its syntactic purpose. (For example, although / has syntactic meaning in a URL, you can use it unencoded in a query string, because it doesn't have meaning in a query string.)
